## Breakout Groups: What You Need To Know

This document is intended as a guide to creating and maintaining successful breakout groups at [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org), Chicago's premier weekly civic tech meetup.

#### 1. Is my idea ready to become a breakout group?

Chi Hack Night is an environment built for your project to thrive, no matter what stage it's at when you bring it here. However, Chi Hack Night is also a very loosely structured event, and a successful breakout group usually exhibits a few key qualities before it meets for the first time.

The civic hacking portion of Chi Hack Night is completely freeform, with no formal mentoring or guidance required for any new group. If you're thinking of starting a breakout group, you should have an understanding of the amount of time you're able to put into managing your project. It's typically a good idea to come in with (or immediately recruit) a leadership team composed of multiple people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, each of whom can help run the group each week, bring new members up to speed, and/or direct various aspects of your collective work.

Aside from essential project management considerations, one of the most important things to bring to your breakout group is a basic understanding of one of the primary mantras of the civic tech community: [build with, not for](https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/build-with-not-for-a-civictech-manifesto/). At every step of your journey, you must keep your stakeholders and end users in mind, and loop them into your development process as much as possible. Nearly every successful civic tech project comes from a team mentality that actively seeks feedback from the communities impacted by its work.
