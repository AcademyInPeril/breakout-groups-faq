## Breakout Groups: What You Need To Know

This document is intended as a guide to creating and maintaining successful breakout groups at [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org), Chicago's premier weekly civic tech meetup. If you have improvements to make, feel free to submit a pull request! Please make sure that your changes are cleanly formatted and fit the purpose of the guide.


#### Before you start, keep this in mind:

This guide is not law. If you think that your idea demands less (or more!) infrastructure than what is outlined here, you're probably right! There is no one correct way to run a breakout group at Chi Hack Night, and you shouldn't feel discouraged from jumping into a project just because a markdown document dictated a bunch of best practices that might not reflect your reality. The suggestions here have been shown to help lead groups down the path to success, but this outline is by no means the only proper way to structure work at Chi Hack Night.

With that in mind, let's get started!


#### 1. Is my idea ready to become a breakout group?

Chi Hack Night is an environment built for your project to thrive, no matter what stage it's at when you bring it here. However, Chi Hack Night is also a very loosely structured event, and a successful breakout group usually exhibits a few key qualities before it meets for the first time.

The civic hacking portion of Chi Hack Night is completely freeform, with no formal mentoring or guidance required for any new group. If you're thinking of starting a breakout group, you should have an understanding of the amount of time you're able to put into managing your project. It's typically a good idea to come in with (or quickly recruit) a leadership team composed of multiple people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints, each of whom can help run the group each week, bring new members up to speed, and/or direct various aspects of your collective work.

Aside from project management considerations, one of the most important things to bring to your breakout group is a basic understanding of one of the primary mantras of the civic tech community: [build with, not for](https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/build-with-not-for-a-civictech-manifesto/). If you're building something for a larger audience, you should keep your stakeholders and end users in mind at every step of your journey, and loop them into your development process as much as possible. Nearly every successful civic tech project comes from a team mentality that actively seeks feedback from the communities impacted by its work.


#### 2. Once I'm ready, how do I officially start a breakout group?

The [list of breakout groups](https://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html) that you see on the Chi Hack Night Website is generated through GitHub, a website used primarily in software development to track project progress. Chi Hack Night has its own GitHub account, and that account is home to the public information about each of our active breakout groups.

To add your new group to the official list on the website, you'll need to have a GitHub account. When logged in, simply follow [this link](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups/issues/new) and fill out the template description that is automatically generated for you. GitHub uses a common system called Markdown for text styling, and you can read [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you're unfamiliar with how Markdown works.

Once your breakout group has been added to the Chi Hack Night list, the next step is to craft a thirty-second pitch for it! Every Tuesday, you will have the chance to explain what your project is and why people should join you. In order to attract participants with the skills you desire, it's usually best to mention the specific tools or topics you're focused on.

Be careful not to take up too much of your time talking about the tech, though: an effective pitch is one that gets people excited about the possibilities of your project. While many of us at Chi Hack Night love our favorite programming languages or the process of technical writing, we're here at a civic tech meetup to make a difference in the world around us. If you can demonstrate how your breakout group will marry tech and social impact, your pitch is more likely to succeed.


#### 3. How do I manage the ongoing work of my breakout group?

Breakout group leaders often face the same types of challenges, regardless of what their group is focused on. Acquainting newcomers with the group, dealing with magical disappearing team members, and structuring work outside Tuesday nights are some of the many common topics of concern that we hear. Because Chi Hack Night is an all-volunteer event, none of your contributors have a requirement to continue showing up past the first time you meet them. While this can introduce some instability, it also means that those who come to you in the first place are likely impressed by your pitch and excited to work on your project. Managing a team in any context takes thought, and Chi Hack Night is no exception.
